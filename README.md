# SmartLearning
This android application is devloped for my research  project using Xamarin froms. 

As the usage of Internet and the smartphone has increased to an enormous level,
our learning method also needs to be modified thus making it compatible with todayÂ´s Era. 
Mobile phones have been become part and parcel of daily lives where we Humans are constantly dependent more on our phones than on computers, 
we are more space independent. Having said that, is it right to say that, eLearning apps can be the future of Learning? 
It enables much faster delivery of products as users can access eLearning material anytime, and anywhere, 
with flexibility not only in terms of time but also learning speed. Since eLearning provides various types of interactive content and multimedia, 
users can retain much more of what they learn and improve their skills and performance. Learning when users have more free time or concentration,
will lead to performance enhancement and higher efficiency.
What makes e learning more unique is the idea that such apps allow their users to revisit any information they need and whenever they wish too.
